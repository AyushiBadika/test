                <p>My association with Dabur has been a little over 1 year but it has truly been a roller coaster. Right from Day 1, I have observed that Dabur entrusts each employee to act independently in their respective sphere of expertise. As an employee, I believe this is extremely empowering and brings out the best of individuals. Within a short span of time, I have been able to work across the Marketing value chain courtesy of the various strategic projects initiated by the management. While this is challenging on one hand but it's a highly fulfilling experience on the other to undergo such a steep learning curve. Me and my colleagues continue to create great memories out of this place with most recent and fun being my 1st annual conference abroad, which only got me closer to this family called Dabur. </p>

               <p> My journey with Dabur has been like an action-packed T-20 game. Just like T-20, Dabur ensures that any youngster who join, gets groomed like an all- rounder. My career started as Management Trainee and in last 5 years, I have had exposure of all trade channels- General Trade, Modern Trade, Ecommerce and now Cash and Carry. All the stints that a Management Trainee goes through are like powerplays which ensure you get all the required skill sets for a long-term career here. Last but not the least, Annual foreign trips are like innings break which give the required recharge time after a hustling fiscal year. All in all, Dabur is the perfect pitch to play the innings of your career</p>
